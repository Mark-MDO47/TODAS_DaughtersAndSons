# TODAS_DaughtersAndSons
Take our Daughters and Sons to Work Day June 2024

At work we are having a take a child to work day and I will be running an Arduino table with a target age range of 9-16 and a time range for each group of one hour.

See https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/TODAS_DaughtersAndSons/blob/master/TODAS_DaughtersAndSons.pdf for details

My initial plan is
- use Arduinos and breadboards
  - have them do some of the connections
  - allow them to direct me in programming using three laptops
  - material contains some depth for those that are more advanced
- focus on switching things off and on
- inputs:
  - switches
  - buttons
  - ultrasound distance sensor
  - capacitive sensing - banana piano!
- outputs:
  - LED
  - WS-2812B LEDs and FastLed
  - speaker and YX5200/DFPlayer
- show Fritzing diagrams and schematics
  - explain switch sensing using water-flow analogy
  - advanced - explain capacitive switch sensing using water-flow analogy
- have some other arduino projects to show, such as
  - Persistence of Vision - https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/ArduinoClass/tree/master/02_PersistenceOfVision
  - Rubber Band Gun - https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/RubberBandGun
  - Graduation Caps - https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/GraduationCap2017
  - Version 0.1 of the Halloween Skull with Eyeballs - https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/HalloweenEyes
  - Voice controlled Christmas tree lights - https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/ArduinoClass/blob/master/FablabChristmasArduinoTable_2023.pdf
