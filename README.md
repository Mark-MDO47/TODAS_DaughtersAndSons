# TODAS_DaughtersAndSons
Take our Daughters and Sons to Work Day June 2024

At work we are having a take a child to work day and I will be running an Arduino table with a target age range of 9-16 and a time range for each group of one hour.

My initial plan is
- use Arduinos and breadboards
  - have them do some of the connections
  - allow them to direct me in programming using one laptop
- focus on switching things off and on
- inputs:
  - buttons and switches
  - capacitive sensing - banana piano!
  - maybe ultrasound distance sensor
  - maybe laser and photoresister - sharks and lasers!
  - maybe voice commanding
- outputs:
  - WS-2812B LEDs
  - speaker
  - maybe bluetooth speaker
- have some other arduino projects to show
  - Persistence of Vision
  - Rubber Band Gun
  - Graduation Caps
  - Version 0.1 of the Halloween Skull with Eyeballs
- show Fritzing diagrams and schematics
  - explain switch sensing using a water-flow analogy
