# TODAS_DaughtersAndSons
Take our Daughters and Sons to Work Day June 2024

At work we are having a take a child to work day and I will be running an Arduino table with a target age range of 9-16 and a time range for each group of one hour.

My initial plan is
- use Arduinos and breadboards
  - have them do some of the connections
  - allow them to direct me in programming using three laptops
  - some depth for those that are more advanced
- focus on switching things off and on
- inputs:
  - buttons and switches and 8 WS2812B LEDs
  - ultrasound distance sensor and 241 WS2812B LEDs
  - capacitive sensing and digitized sounds - banana piano!
- outputs:
  - WS-2812B LEDs
  - speaker
- show Fritzing diagrams and schematics
  - explain switch sensing using water-flow analogy
  - advanced - explain capacitive switch using water-flow analogy
- have some other arduino projects to show
  - Persistence of Vision
  - Rubber Band Gun
  - Graduation Caps
  - Version 0.1 of the Halloween Skull with Eyeballs
